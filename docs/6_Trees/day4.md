# Unit 6 - Day 4: AVL Trees

## The Flaw in Binary Search Trees
  * They can become unbalanced

## What is an AVL Tree?
  * Self-balancing binary search tree
  * How does it work?

## What does it mean for a tree to become "un-balanced"?
  * For every node in a tree, the difference in height between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1.

## Cases of Un-Balance
  * Case 1
    * Left Left
  * Case 2
    * Left Right
  * Case 3
    * Right Left
  * Case 4
    * Right Right
