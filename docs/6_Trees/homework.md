# Unit 6 - Homework: Traversing a Binary Search Tree

Using the binary search tree implementation from the [Binary Search Trees](day2.md) lecture, create a program that fulfills the following requirements:
  * Traverses the tree and displays each node and its data to the screen in some way
  * Implements all three traversal methods
    * In-order, pre-order, and post-order
  * Uses user input to determine which traversal algorithm should be used.
