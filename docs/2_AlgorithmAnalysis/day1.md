# Unit 2 - Day 1: Analyzing Algorithms

## How Do We Analyze Algorithms?
  * What factors affect how long it will take a program to run?
  * How can we estimate how long it will take an algorithm to run?
    * Which factors do we focus on?
    * Basic operations
      * AND, OR, NOT, +, -, <, >, ==, =
  * How do we compare the efficiency of different algorithms that solve the same problem?
