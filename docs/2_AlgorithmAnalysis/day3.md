# Unit 2 - Day 3: Big-Oh Analysis

## Big-Oh Analysis
  * How do we determine the Big-Oh classification of an algorithm?
    * Basic operatoins, for loops, if statements, switch statements
  
## Best Case, Worst Case, and Average Case
  * What are the possible best case, worst case, and average case scenarios for different algorithms?
  * How do these cases affect our analysis of the algorithm?

## Application of Algorithm Analysis
  * Comparison of basic searching algorithms
    * Binary search vs. Sequential seach
