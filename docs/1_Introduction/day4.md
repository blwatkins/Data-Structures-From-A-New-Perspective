# Unit 1 - Day 4: Basic Data Structures, Structs and Arrays

## What is a Data Structure?
  * What is the purpose of data structures?
  * Why do we use them in programming?
  * Why do we have different types of data structures?

## Basic Data Structures
  * Variable
  * Collections of variables
    * Structs
    * Arrays
    * Vectors and Array Lists
   * How do arrays compare to array lists? Are they better? Worse? How do we know?

## Basic Functions of a Data Structure
  * Access
  * Insert
  * Delete
  * Find
  * Sort

## How Do We Perform these Functions with Basic Arrays?
  * Focus on access and insert
