# Unit 3 - Day 5: Homework Review and Small Group Discussions

## Steps
  1. The class will be randomly divided into 3 equal groups, one group for each sorting algorithm that was covered during lecture.
  2. Each group will discuss and explain their implementations of the assigned sorting algorithm.
  3. The group will either choose or create what they believe to be the best version of their sorting algorithm
      * Each group member should be prepared to explain and answer questions about the optimized algorithm
