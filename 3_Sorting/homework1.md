# Unit 3 - Homework: Visualizing Text

In a Java IDE, create a Processing sketch that satifies the following criteria:
  * Gets input from a text file
  * Displays each word in the text as a circle on the screen
    * Circle size and color should be determined by the word it represents in some way
    * The position of the circle should be determined by its position in the array
      * Example: element 0 of the array would be displayed in the top-left corner, and the last element would be displayed in the bottom-right corner
  * The text from the file should be stored in a `String[]` array
    * The circles should be generated by looping through the string array

Note: You do not have to account for punctuation or case. "Alice", "alice", and "alice!" can count as 3 separate words
