# Unit 3 - Day 2: Selection Sort

## What happens when we call `sort(...)`?
  * values are changed around according to the rules of whatever sorting algorithm is being executed
  * Many different kinds of sorting algorithms
  * `sort(...)` function implements an optimized and heavily tested version of one or more algorithms

## Selection Sort

### How does it work?
  * Paper and pen implementation

### Algorithm Analysis
  * Best case
  * Worst case
  * Average case
