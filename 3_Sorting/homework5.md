# Unit 3 - Homework: Empirical Analysis

## Step 1
Using the Processing sketch from the [Visualizing Text](https://github.com/blwatkins/Data-Structures-From-A-New-Perspective/blob/master/3_Sorting/homework1.md) assignment, and the optimized sorting Algorithm your group created during the [homework review and small group discussions](https://github.com/blwatkins/Data-Structures-From-A-New-Perspective/blob/master/3_Sorting/day5.md), perform an empirical analysis of your group's sorting algorithm.  You should test the algorithm on at least 10 data sets of increasing length, recording how long it takes the sorting algorithm to execute for each data set.

## Step 2
Plot a graph that shows the size of the data vs. the time it took the algorithm to sort the data.  Write a short paragraph explaining why you chose the data sets that you did, how you gathered the timing data, and how the results of the tests compare to the expected performance of the algorithm.
